# redisedge - a Docker image with select Redis Labs modules for the Edge

This container image bundles together [Redis](https://redis.io) with Redis modules from [Redis Labs](https://redislabs.com) for Edge computing.

## Modules included in the container

* [RedisTimeSeries](https://oss.redislabs.com/redistimeseries/): a timeseries database
* [RedisAI](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisai/): a tensor and deep learning graphs server
* [RedisGears](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisgears/): a dynamic execution framework

## Configuring the Redis server

This image is based on the [official image of Redis from Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/). By default, the container starts with Redis' default configuration and all included modules loaded.

You can, of course, override the defaults. This can be done either by providing additional command line arguments to the `docker` command, or by providing your own [Redis configuration file](http://download.redis.io/redis-stable/redis.conf).

### Running the container with command line arguments

You can provide Redis with configuration directives directly from the `docker` command. For example, the following will start the container, mount the host's `/home/user/data` volume to the container's `/data`, load the RedisAI module, and configure Redis' working directory to `/data` so that the data will actually be persisted there.

```text
$ docker run \
  -p 6379:6379 \
  -v /home/user/data:/data \
  redislabs/redisedge \
  --loadmodule /usr/lib/redis/modules/redisai.so \
  --dir /data
```

### Running the container with a custom configuration file

This image uses a custom configuration file (located at `/etc/redisedge.conf`. You can use that as a starting point for putting together your own and store it somewhere like `/home/user/myredisedge.conf`. You can then load the container with the custom configuration file likeso:

```text
$ docker run \
  -p 6379:6379 \
  -v /home/user/data:/data \
  -v /home/user/myredisedge.conf:/usr/local/etc/redisedge.conf \
  redislabs/redisedge \
  /usr/local/etc/redisedge.conf
```
